 * TemporaryNumber
 *
 * Until April 2001, employers sometimes allocated their employees a temporary insurance number,
 * which followed the format "TN dd mm yy x", where 'TN' stands for temporary number and is static
 * and x is M for male, F for female, or P for pensioner and the numbers in the midsection were
 * the employee's date of birth.
